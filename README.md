# Adversarial-Style
This is the code of paper: Generating adversarial examples under the hardest conditions
For runing this code:
## Preparation
python 3.6
pytorch 1.3
tensorflow1.5(optional)
tensorboardX1.6(optionnal)
## Training
For training, please prepare:
  1. A dataset of source images(natural images). In the paper, we used ImageNet 2017 dataset.
  2. A pretrained victim classifier in ./data. In the paper, we used pretrained vgg19. One can download it by searching: imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat. 
  3. A low-frequency fooling image. We provide some generated examples in ./style. One can recover our results in the paper by them. We will also upload the generating code soon for users' freely generation. 
     Actually, it can be easily generated by adopt the code of Google project: Lucid, if you can't wait.
Then run: python style.py

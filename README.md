For runing this code:

## Preparation

python 3.6

pytorch 1.3

tensorflow1.5(optional)

tensorboardX1.6(optional)

## Training

For training, please prepare:

    1. A dataset of source images(natural images). In the paper, we used ImageNet 2017 dataset.
    2. A pretrained victim classifier in ./data. In the paper, we used pretrained vgg19. One can download it by searching: imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat. 
    3. A low-frequency fooling image. We provide some generated examples in ./style. One can reproduce our results in the paper by them. We will also upload the generating code soon for the freely generation. 
       Actually, it can be easily generated by adopting the code of Google project: Lucid, if you can't wait.

Then run: python style.py --train-path ./your_training_dataset_path --style ./fooling_image_path
